.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm wired

.Op Fl d Ar server_root
.Op Fl f Ar config_file
.Op Fl i Ar log_lines
.Op Fl L Ar log_file
.Op Fl s Ar syslog_facility
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm wired
is the Wired server program, implementing the Wired chat and file transfer protocol. It is designed to run as a standalone server. On startup,
.Nm wired
will read the specified configuration file, bind to the specified ports and listen for connections. It is recommended that
.Xr wiredctl 1
is used to control the starting and stopping of
.Nm wired .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
Listen on IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Listen on IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl D
Do not daemonize.
.Nm wired
will run in the foreground and log to
. Va stderr .
.It Fl d Ar server_root
Sets the server root path.
.Nm wired
will attempt to locate its required files under this directory, and
.Xr chroot 2
to it unless
.Fl u
is specified. The default value is set to the path
.Nm wired
was originally installed as, so it will most often not need to be set.
.It Fl f Ar config_file
Sets the path of the configuration file, relative to
.Va server_root .
The default is
.Pa etc/wired.conf .
.It Fl h
Displays a brief help message and exits.
.It Fl i Ar log_lines
When logging to a file using
.Fl L ,
limit the number of lines the log may occupy to
.Ar log_lines .
.It Fl L Ar log_file
Sets the path of the file that
.Nm wired
will log to. If it is not set,
.Nm wired
will instead log via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.It Fl l
Increases the log level. By default,
.Nm wired
will log everything but debug messages. Use this flag once to also log debug messages.
.It Fl s Ar syslog_facility
Sets the
.Xr syslog 3
facility to use for logging. See
for information on possible values. The default is
.Va daemon .
.It Fl t
Runs a configuration syntax test and exit.
.It Fl u
By default
.Nm wired
will
.Xr chroot 2
to the
.Va server_root
path. This flag disables this behaviour. As a result of the default secure behaviour,
.Nm wired
cannot access any files outside
.Va server_root .
.It Fl v
Displays version information and exits.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION FILE
.Nm wired
reads configuration data from
.Va config_file .
The file format and configuration options are described in
.Xr wired.conf 5 .
.Sh FILES
The locations of these files can be configured in
.Va config_file ,
this list describes the default locations. All files are contained within the
.Va server_root
path.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa etc/wired.conf
A configuration file for
.Nm wired .
Its file format is described in
.Xr wired.conf 5 .
.It Pa files/
A directory containing all files that are publically available to connected users.
.It Pa wired.status
A status file for the daemon. It is written to periodically, and is used by
.Xr wiredctl 8
and others to display some statistics. The file is a series of numbers, separated by a space character:
.Pp
.Dl time of startup
.Dl number of online users
.Dl total number of users
.Dl number of active downloads
.Dl total number of downloads
.Dl number of active uploads
.Dl total number of uploads
.Dl number of bytes downloaded
.Dl number of bytes uploaded
